# Problem2

Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

## Note: 

This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to  are acceptable.

For example, given the array = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]  there are 5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios would be 2/5 = 0.40000, 2/5 = 0.40000  and 1.5 = 0.20000 . It should be printed as:

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
